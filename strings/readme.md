### Help Us Add More Languages to ChiefMusic! How to Contribute?

We are always looking for contributors to help us translate ChiefMusic into more languages. Here's how you can contribute:

1. **Edit the Language File:**  
   You can start by editing the [`en.yml`](https://github.com/hakutakaid/Music-Indo/blob/master/strings%2Flangs%2Fen.yml) file, which contains the English language strings, and translate it into your language.

2. **Submit Your Translation:**  
   Once you've completed your translation, send the edited file to us at [@ZeebSupport](https://t.me/ZeebSupport) or open a pull request in our GitHub repository.

### Points to Remember While Editing:

- **Do Not Modify Placeholders:**  
  Ensure that placeholders like `{0}`, `{1}`, etc., are not changed when translating your strings, as they play a crucial role in dynamic text rendering.

- **Maintain Key Consistency:**  
  Be careful not to change keys such as "general_1" or any other keys present in the file, as these should remain intact.

By contributing to ChiefMusic translations, you help make it accessible to more users around the world. Thank you for your support!
